# DVD-Shop-Project
The analysis of data for this project is done in MySQL, on the Sakila database.

Originally developed by MySQL, Sakila Database has been made available as open source software under the provisions of the BSD License. The Sakila database is a well normalized schema that simulates a DVD rental shop. It includes information about movies, actors, and the relationships between movies and their cast members, as well as a central inventory table that links movies, stores, and rentals.

The goal of this analysis is to practice, have fun, and show off my SQL and PowerBI visualisation abilities. I wasn't trying to find an answer to a specific business question; instead, I was looking for some intriguing information in the data.


The analysis's initial section is shown in the image below. As you can see, the dataset contains several tables, giving me the chance to practice one of the most crucial procedures: JOIN functions!

On the hastags (comments) prior to the query you can see the purpuse of the query and what I wanted to get out of the data.


Here are some examples:

**Revenue by movie**

**Here we can see that even though "Mike Hillyer" rented more movies, "Jon Stephens" generated more revenue**
